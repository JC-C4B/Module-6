# Module-6
A repository holding Projects 4 & 5 from our CSC6301 course.

Module 4 project;
  Reading a list of integers from a scanned input and saving them into a Linked List sorted from smallest to largest while making use of the collections framework.
  
Module 5 Project:
  A program that modifies the Module 4 project to read a list of integers from a scanned input and save them into a stack sorted from smallest to largest, while making use of the collections framework. 
  This folder includes a text file that outlines the plan for switching from a linked list to a stack.
