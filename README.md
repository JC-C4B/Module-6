Module 5 Project:
  A program that modifies the Module 4 project to read a list of integers from a scanned input and save them into a stack sorted from smallest to largest, while making use of the collections framework. 
  This folder includes a text file that outlines the plan for switching from a linked list to a stack.

Usage:

If you'd like to use the code from either project, you may do so by downloading the .java files found within the the 'src' folders in either project and running it in a java-based interpreter (I personally use the extensions found within Visual Studio code).

you can find more information on the goal of this repository and it's contents in the [wiki](https://github.com/JC-C4B/Module-6/wiki)!
